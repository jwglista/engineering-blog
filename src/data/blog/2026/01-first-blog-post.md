  Initial setup and using Copilot to help accelerate the process
---

I've been using AI chat bots casually for over a year now (kind of late to the game), but only recently (since Nov 2025 or so) have I been using it for software development at work.  It didn't take long to realize the power of generative AI for writing code and helping to understand complex codebases, but it really does feel like the wild west at the moment.  Things are advancing so fast, and there seems to be many different ways to potentially accomplish the same things.

My goal with this blog is to capture my experiences and thoughts around how the landscape of software engineering is currently entering a new era.  I expect some posts to be simply a record of something I accomplished or learned, and others to perhaps be philosophical thoughts around these rapid changes that are occurring.  Hopefully some of my posts will be helpful or interesting to others.  If not, then I'll at least have an interesting set of posts to go back and read years from now.

I've been using a blend of Gemini and GitHub Copilot to assist so far.  Gemini was fantastic at recommending web frameworks and sites to help easily deploy the code.  I used Gemini mainly for the discovery of frameworks and sites for hosting/deployment, and used Copilot in VS Code to help understand the Astro codebase much quicker.  Using these tools I was able to get this site up and running in only a few hours, without having to take hours of tutorials on JavaScript, TypeScript, web frameworks, etc.  I particularly like how I can ask Copilot questions on language syntax for a new language, and it's specific to the file I'm viewing.  Being able to go back and forth and learn about the language in the exact flow that I wish makes the learning much more effective, rather than having to read a linear set of reference docs.
