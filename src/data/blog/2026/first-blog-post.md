  Initial setup and using Copilot to help accelerate the process
---

I've been using AI chat bots casually for over a year now (kind of late to the game), but only recently (since Nov 2025 or so) have I been using it for software development at work.  It didn't take long to realize the power of generative AI for writing code and helping to understand complex codebases, but it really does feel like the wild west at the moment.  Things are advancing so fast, and there seems to be many different ways to potentially accomplish the same things.

My goal with this blog is to capture my experiences and thoughts around how the landscape of software engineering is currently entering a new era.  I expect some posts to be simply a record of something I accomplished or learned, and others to perhaps be philosophical thoughts around these rapid changes that are occurring.  Hopefully some of my posts will be helpful or interesting to others.  If not, then I'll at least have an interesting set of posts to go back and read years from now.
